<h2> Course Description </h2>

<p>
It is essential for CISOs to have a global vision of how systems work, and to be familiar with the various components that make them up, so as to be able to put in place the appropriate policies to prevent potential faults.
</p>

<p>
To achieve this, students need to be trained in the concept of defense in depth, which consists in multiplying the layers of defense to reduce the impact of a component failure.
</p>

<p>
With this in mind, this course covers the various defense and isolation mechanisms implemented by the most widely used operating systems (Windows and Linux). 
It goes into more detail on each concept for both operating systems, with practical exercises for direct application.    
</p>

<p>54 hours (18h teaching + 12h supervised work + 24h labs)</p>
