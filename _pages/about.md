My research focuses on vulnerabilities in cryptographic implementations, which can be related to the core protocol (if there is an issue in the specification) or implementation-specific (side channels or any information leak). I am also developing a strong interest in microarchitectural security, with practical exploitation.

Since April 1st, I am a research engineer at INRIA, team [CAPSULE](https://team.inria.fr/capsule/), working on various ways to improve post-quantum cryptography implementations' security. I got my PhD from the Universisty of Rennes in 2022, with the supervision of [Pierre-Alain Fouque](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fouque/) and [Mohamed Sabt](http://people.irisa.fr/Mohamed.Sabt/) in the [SPICY](https://spicy.irisa.fr/) team (former EMSEC) at IRISA in Rennes. My work was awarded the Google PhD fellowship in Privacy & Security, which allowed me to visit [Daniel Gruss](https://gruss.cc/)'s team [CoreSec](https://www.iaik.tugraz.at/research-area/securesystems/) at Graz University of Technology for 4 months in 2023.

Before starting my PhD, I graduated from [Rennes 1's Cryptography Master](https://formations.univ-rennes1.fr/master-mention-mathematiques-et-applications-parcours-mathematiques-de-linformation-cryptographie) in 2018, and  worked one year at [Amossys](https://www.amossys.fr/) (Rennes, France) as a security analyst.
